> What Is GachaBot?

GachaBot is an automated bot designed to interact with the Gacha system on Discord. It performs actions like "drop" and "grab" cards automatically based on user-defined settings. The bot verifies license keys to ensure authenticity, uses screen detection to identify graphical elements, and logs detailed updates. GachaBot is configurable through a graphical interface and supports multiple features like half-drop and half-grab, as well as protection against duplicate key usage.<br>

Currently, it only supports the Gachapon bot on Discord.
